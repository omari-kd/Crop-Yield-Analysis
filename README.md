# Crop-Yield-Analysis

<div>

Crop yield is influenced by several factors, including temperature, NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) levels in the soil and fertilizer application. Optimal Temperature ranges vary depending on the crop, but generally, excessive heat or cold can negatively impact growth and yield.

NPK levels play a crucial role in plant nutrition, with nitrogen promoting vegetative growth, Phosphorus supporting root development and flowering and Potassium enhancing overall plant health and disease resistance.

Fertilizer application can improve crop yield by replenishing essential nutrients in the soil, but its important to use the right type and amount of fertilizer for the specific crop and soil conditions.

**Dataset Overview**

<div>

The dataset contains 109 observations of 7 variables. These variables include:

1.  Rainfall in mm
2.  Temperature, possibly in degree celsius
3.  Fertilizer, presumably the amount of NPK fertilizer applied
4.  Nitrogen (N), soil nitrogen level before fertilization
5.  Phosphorus (P), soil phosphorus level
6.  Potassium (K), soil potassium level
7.  Yield in quantity per acre (q/acre), that is crop output

Since no additional document is provided, assuming:

-   Fertilizer is the total NPK fertilizer applied, rather than broken down into individual N, P, K values.

-   N, P, K are baseline soil nutrient levels before any fertilizer is added
