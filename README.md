# Crop-Yield-Analysis

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
Crop yield is influenced by several factors, including temperature, NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) levels in the soil and fertilizer application. Optimal Temperature ranges vary depending on the crop, but generally, excessive heat or cold can negatively impact growth and yield.

NPK levels play a crucial role in plant nutrition, with nitrogen promoting vegetative growth, Phosphorus supporting root development and flowering and Potassium enhancing overall plant health and disease resistance.

Fertilizer application can improve crop yield by replenishing essential nutrients in the soil, but its important to use the right type and amount of fertilizer for the specific crop and soil conditions.
